### To configure the tier levels for mod perms, set uo four user flairs with blank text, the following four css_classes and your own template ID.  Flair text can be used, but may be confusing for users.  Css class is hidden. 
### You can define your own css_classes in config.json, or use the ones here, but you must set up and change the template id.

 ### Set up a system to draft users to moderate one post.  Flair css class is assigned allowing them to send a !approve or !remove command.  For approve, automoderator approves post, for remove, the bot will remove it.  Users not allowed to comment further until they send one command.


 # Randomly assign users at a 50% percentage based on ending letter of comment ID. Users must have 50 sub level karma.

     Congratulations!  You've been selected as a post moderator on r/PoliticalHumor. It's difficult to find willing mods to volunteer their time moderating a subreddit, that's why we need your help!  Before you can comment or post again on the subreddit, you will need to **review one post**.  
     
     **How to review a post:** Go to r/politicalhumor/new and review one of the newest posts.  To approve the post, all you have to do is comment ```!approve``` and to remove the post, just type ```!remove```.
